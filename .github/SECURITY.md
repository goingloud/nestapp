## Supported versions

nestapp follows semantic versioning. Fixes are applied to the latest released
minor version only; there is no long-term support for older lines.

| Version | Supported |
|---------|-----------|
| 2.1.x   | yes       |
| 2.0 and earlier | no |
| 1.0.0   | no — superseded by 2.1.0, see [CHANGELOG](../CHANGELOG.md) |

`1.0.0` was the open-source re-baseline of an application already released as
`v1.01`-`v2.0`. Numbering continues from the 2.x line so that the newest release
is unambiguously the newest code; 1.0.0 is not a supported line.

## Scope

nestapp is a desktop research tool that runs locally in MATLAB and processes
EEG/TMS-EEG data files the user already trusts. It is not a network service and
does not handle credentials. The most relevant concerns are therefore:

- Crafted data files (e.g. `.set`, `.vhdr`) that could trigger unsafe behavior
  when loaded.
- The `Manual Command` pipeline step, which executes user-supplied MATLAB code
  by design — only run pipelines you trust.
- Third-party dependencies — EEGLAB and its plugins (TESA, FastICA, ICLabel,
  PICARD, CleanLine, clean_rawdata, firfilt) and the AARATEP helpers.
  Vulnerabilities in those belong upstream, but tell us if a nestapp default
  exposes one. Note that nestapp **redistributes none of them**: EEGLAB and its
  plugins are installed by the user through EEGLAB's extension manager, and
  `Help > Install AARATEP Helpers...` downloads a pinned upstream release over
  HTTPS from GitHub.
- The toolbox package (`.mltbx`) attached to a release, which MATLAB installs
  into the user's add-ons folder. It contains only files tracked in this
  repository — the packaging script takes its file list from `git ls-files`
  rather than globbing the working tree, so an untracked local dependency
  cannot be shipped inside it.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please do **not** open a public GitHub issue for security problems.

Email **dunne.wesley@gmail.com** with:

- a description of the issue and its impact,
- steps to reproduce (a minimal example if possible),
- environment details — run `nestappDoctor` (or Help → Copy Diagnostics)
  and include the output.

We will acknowledge receipt within a reasonable timeframe, work with you on a
fix, and credit you in the release notes unless you prefer otherwise.
