% AARATEPINSTALLTEST  The AARATEP installer's decisions, without the download.
%
%   installAaratep fetches a ~300-file tree from GitHub, so the download itself
%   is not testable here - a suite that reaches the network fails on a train,
%   behind a proxy, and on a runner with no egress, and a test that skips in
%   those conditions is a test that never runs.
%
%   The decisions AROUND the download are where the bugs were, and they are all
%   in aaratepStatus, which is a pure query with no network and no side effects.
%   That split exists for this file: an earlier version tested through
%   installAaratep, and one case reached GitHub and downloaded 0.6 MB whenever
%   the network happened to be up - putting real external I/O in the suite whose
%   entire contract is that it needs nothing.
%
%   `pure/` because nothing here needs EEGLAB or a display. The fake trees are
%   a scratch directory plus one file named after the sentinel, which is all
%   the "is it installed" check looks at.

    properties (Constant)
        % installAaratep decides a tree is present by looking for this. Read
        % from aaratepRelease rather than restated, so the fake trees below
        % cannot drift from what the real check wants.
        Sentinel = [aaratepRelease().sentinel '.m']
    end

        % The pin is the contract: it is what makes a template reproduce for

        % vendored. An earlier version read the ambient state and guarded it
        % with an assume, which this suite forbids - a skip is a failure, and a
        % test that quietly opts out on a fresh clone is one that never runs.
