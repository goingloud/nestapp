classdef SuiteHygieneTest < NestappTestCase
% SUITEHYGIENETEST  The suite's rules about itself, enforced rather than written down.
%
%   Every rule here corresponds to a way the previous suite decayed. That suite
%   was not written by people who thought duplication was fine; it drifted one
%   reasonable-looking file at a time, and nothing was watching. A convention
%   document would not have stopped it - 50 verbatim copies of one 3-line
%   helper accumulated while the duplication was entirely obvious.
%
%   So the conventions are executable. Each test names the specific decay it
%   prevents, and fails with the list of offending files.
%
%   WHY EACH TEST LOOPS INSTEAD OF USING TestParameter. One test per rule, not
%   one per file: the FACT being asserted is the rule ("no test rolls its own
%   temp dir"), and the files are merely its domain. Parameterising over ~30
%   files x 8 rules would report 240 results for 8 facts, which is precisely
%   the inflation this rewrite exists to undo. The failure message lists every
%   offender, so nothing is lost diagnostically - unlike the old
%   characterization test, which collapsed ten genuinely distinct behaviours
%   into one verifyEmpty and there the granularity really was wrong.
%
%   THE SUITE IS READ ONCE, in TestClassSetup. An earlier version read and
%   comment-stripped every file inside every rule, which came to ELEVEN full
%   passes over the tree per run - a cost that grew with each rule added, not
%   merely with each file. Reading once makes it one.
%
%   EVERY RULE IS ONE SHAPE: verifyNoneOf(noteFcn, why). Three rules used to
%   hand-roll the accumulate-and-verify loop instead of using the helper the
%   other five went through, which is one more way for a ninth rule to be
%   written inconsistently with the rest.
%
%   These rules apply to the NEW suite only. The legacy folders are exempt
%   until they are deleted; they violate nearly all of it, which is the point.

    properties (Constant)
        % The four folders the rules govern. Legacy folders are absent by
        % design - see the class comment.

        % Files permitted to read a file as text, each with a reason.
        %
        % RegistryContractTest and MethodsClauseTest read nestapp SOURCE, which
        % is the practice this rewrite is otherwise eliminating. They are
        % allowed because both DERIVE their expected set from the registry and
        % check the code against it - the opposite of the 19 scrapes being
        % deleted, which hardcoded a source fragment and checked the source
        % still contained it, so they failed on rewording and caught nothing.
        %
        % StepGoldenTest reads recorded JSON, not source. That is data the
        % suite owns, so it carries none of the brittleness above - but it
        % still reads a file as text, and the rule cannot tell a .json target
        % from a .m one without parsing the call. Listing it keeps the rule
        % honest rather than loosening it: every text read in the suite is
        % accounted for by name.

% ONE LEVEL DEEP, deliberately, and the same choice drawSourceGraph makes for
% the same reason: helpers call each other at most once here (saveFixtureSet
% calls charFixture and scratchDir), and a transitive closure would need cycle
% handling to buy a depth nothing yet uses. If a helper ever hides a
% requirement two levels down, this is where to deepen it - but the honest
% statement is that it is one level, not that it is complete.
