% APPSTARTUPTEST  What must be true of a launched app: its steps, its geometry, its dirty flag.
%
%   The only file in eeglab_gui/, and the folder exists for this file's first
%   test. A2.1 is the regression the plan named when it chose folders over
%   tags: the old suite split it in two because its taxonomy had nowhere to put
%   a test that needs BOTH EEGLAB and a display -
%   regression/test_startupStepAvailability.m grepped the ordering out of the
%   source, ui/test_startupPicker.m checked the resulting tree, 151 lines and
%   two cross-referencing headers for one fact. Here it is one test.
%
%   EVERY TEST LAUNCHES ITS OWN APP. 3.5 s each, which is the most expensive
%   thing in the suite, and shared deliberately nowhere: two of these four
%   mutate app state (a resize, a save) and one needs a launch under conditions
%   it sets up itself. A shared app would make the results order-dependent,
%   which is the failure the old ui/ suite had - a leaked eeglab('nogui') and a
%   leaked path memo made it fragile on a second run in one session.
%
%   Ledger rows: A2.1 (cold start hid 32 of 54 steps), A3.9 (resize re-entrancy),
%   A3.10 (tabs excluded by type, not by name), A1.7 (a saved pipeline stayed
%   marked unsaved). A3.11 was dropped - it guarded a refactor, not a defect.
