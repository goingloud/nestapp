**nestapp** is a MATLAB GUI for cleaning and analysing TMS-EEG recordings. It wraps [EEGLAB](https://eeglab.org/), [TESA](https://nigelrogasch.gitbook.io/tesa-user-manual/), and [FastICA](http://research.ics.aalto.fi/ica/fastica/) into a point-and-click pipeline builder that lets researchers process data without writing code.

## Requirements

| Dependency | Version |
|---|---|
| MATLAB | R2023b or later (developed on R2025b) |
| EEGLAB | 2025.0.0 |
| TESA | 1.1.1 |
| FastICA | 2.5 |
| Signal Processing Toolbox | any recent |
| Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox | any recent |
| Curve Fitting Toolbox | required only for the `TMS-EEG / AARATEP` template (`Remove Decay Artifact` step) |

**EEGLAB** — download from [eeglab.org](https://eeglab.org/) and unzip anywhere on your machine. nestapp will add it to the MATLAB path automatically once you set the folder in Preferences (see below).

**TESA** — install from inside EEGLAB via **File → Manage EEGLAB extensions**. Search for TESA and install. TESA lives inside the EEGLAB plugins folder, so no separate path setup is needed after that.

**FastICA** — download from [research.ics.aalto.fi/ica/fastica](http://research.ics.aalto.fi/ica/fastica/) and add the folder to your MATLAB path (Home tab → Set Path → Add Folder). FastICA must be on the path before launching nestapp.

**AARATEP** *(only needed for the `TMS-EEG / AARATEP` template)* — the AARATEP pipeline's helper functions are not bundled with this repository. Clone them into `third_party/aaratep/` from the project root:
```bash
cd third_party
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/chriscline/AARATEPPipeline.git aaratep
```
nestapp adds this tree to the MATLAB path automatically when an AARATEP step runs. The AARATEP template also requires the **Curve Fitting Toolbox** (for the `Remove Decay Artifact` step). See [`THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`](THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md) for the pinned commit and licensing.

## Getting started

**First-time setup (do this once):**

1. Install EEGLAB, TESA, and FastICA as described above.
2. Add FastICA to your MATLAB path via **Home → Set Path → Add Folder**, then save.
3. Clone or download this repository and open MATLAB in the project root.
4. Run the entry point:
   ```matlab
   run_nestapp
   ```
5. Open **Settings → Preferences** and set the EEGLAB installation folder. nestapp will add EEGLAB to the path automatically on every launch after this.

**Typical workflow:**

1. **File → Load Template** to start from a ready-made pipeline, or build one from scratch in the Cleaning tab.
2. Select your data files and press **Run Analysis**.
3. Review the per-file summary in the **Reports** tab.
4. Load the processed files in the **Explore** tab to compare conditions and inspect TEPs.
5. Switch to the **Analysis** tab to view detected TEP components and export peak data to CSV.

## Cleaning tab

### Building a pipeline

- The left panel lists all available processing steps. Click a step to see a description and parameter details in the **Info** panel.
- Use **Add** (or double-click a step) to append it to the **Selected Steps** list.
- Use **Remove**, **Move Up**, and **Move Down** to edit the order.
- Click any step in **Selected Steps** to view and edit its parameters in the table below. **Default Value** resets parameters for that step.
- **Re/Start Steps** clears the pipeline after a confirmation prompt.

### Pipeline templates

**File → Load Template** provides ready-to-use starting points:

| Template | Description |
|---|---|
| TMS-EEG / TEP (TESA) | Full TESA two-round-ICA artifact removal for single-pulse TMS (Rogasch 2017) |
| TMS-EEG / AARATEP | Cline 2021 pipeline (SOUND + decay-fit removal + AR-blend interp + TMS-aware muscle classifier); helpers vendored under `third_party/aaratep/` |
| Resting-State EEG | PREP + Delorme 2023 cleaning with ICLabel |
| Minimal ERP | HPF + bad channels + ICA, minimum-handling philosophy |

### Citing nestapp

When you publish results produced with a built-in template, cite the corresponding paper. The template name itself is logged at the start of every batch run alongside the DOI and full reference, so the citation ends up in the run log next to your data.

| Template | Primary citation | Additional |
|---|---|---|
| TMS-EEG / TEP (TESA) | Rogasch et al. (2017). NeuroImage 147:934-951. doi:10.1016/j.neuroimage.2017.06.014 | — |
| TMS-EEG / AARATEP | Cline et al. (2021). IEEE NER. doi:10.1109/NER49283.2021.9441147 | Mutanen et al. (2018) NeuroImage 166:135-151 doi:10.1016/j.neuroimage.2017.10.021 — SOUND algorithm. Rogasch et al. (2017) — TESA helpers vendored from AARATEPPipeline depend on TESA. |

### Saving and loading pipelines

- **File → Save Pipeline** saves the current step list and parameters as a `.mat` file.
- **File → Load Pipeline** restores a previously saved pipeline.
- Recent pipelines are listed under **File → Recent Pipelines**.

### Running the pipeline

1. Select the data files to process (`.set`, `.vhdr`, `.cnt`, `.cdt`).
2. Press **Run Analysis**. A progress dialog shows the current file and step; processing can be cancelled between steps.

After the run, the **Reports** tab opens automatically with a per-file summary including channel counts, trial retention, and ICA statistics.

### Pipeline provenance

Every processed file has the full pipeline — steps, parameters, and a timestamp — written into `EEG.history` and preserved inside the saved `.set` file. After a run, the final processed dataset is available in the MATLAB base workspace. To inspect the processing record:

```matlab
EEG.history      % full log as a string
eegh             % browse interactively using EEGLAB's history viewer
```

## Explore tab

The Explore tab supports the comparison most TMS-EEG studies are designed
around - pre versus post, or one cohort against another. It works on processed
`.set` files: output from a nestapp run, or any EEGLAB-compatible epoched
dataset.

- **Add group...** assigns recordings to a named condition. A group is defined
  over SUBJECTS, so repeat recordings of one person are averaged before the
  group estimate is formed and the reported n counts participants, not files.
- **Files, subjects, groups...** shows and corrects which file belongs to whom.
  This is where n comes from.
- **Design** is set explicitly as paired or unpaired. Paired is offered only
  when every group holds the same subjects.
- **Region of interest** is chosen from a scalp diagram or a named preset,
  defaulting to `AF3 F1 F3 FC1 FC3`.
- **Windows** define the intervals measured. Each carries a peak polarity
  (`auto`/`pos`/`neg`) deciding which way its peak is read. The same table
  switches to **results**, reporting the mean, peak latency and peak amplitude
  for the group selected in the groups list.

The plot picker offers the region-of-interest waveform, global and local mean
field power, the difference wave, scalp topographies, a TEP-topo grid, and a
per-window bar chart. A plot that cannot be drawn with the current settings is
listed with the reason rather than hidden. Plot-specific settings are behind
**Options...**.

Three export routes:

- **Figure...** composes the plot at a chosen column width and resolution,
  stamping the groups, sample sizes, design and ROI into a caption line so the
  image stays interpretable once separated from the session.
- **Measures -> CSV...** writes one row per subject, group and window.
- **Results -> MATLAB...** writes the complete result, curves included.
  `File > Load Analysis` reads it back, restoring the groups, subject
  assignments, ROI, windows, design and plot selection.

## Reports tab

After each pipeline run, a summary report is added to the **Reports** tab. Each report shows channel counts, trial retention, and ICA component statistics for one file. Reports can be browsed, copied as a ready-to-paste methods paragraph, and exported as CSV for multi-subject batch summaries.

---

## Preferences

Open **Settings → Preferences** to configure:

- EEGLAB installation path
- Default data and pipeline folders
- Whether to show the Reports tab automatically after each run
- Whether to require confirmation before clearing a pipeline

## Citing nestapp

If you use nestapp in published work, please cite it using the metadata in [CITATION.cff](CITATION.cff) (GitHub's "Cite this repository" button generates APA/BibTeX for you). Also cite the pipeline papers for any built-in template you run — these are listed per template under **Pipeline templates → Citing nestapp** above and are logged to the run output. See [THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md](THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md) for all bundled and vendored dependencies.
