function [ok, msg] = ensureEeglabReady()
% ENSUREEEGLABREADY  Put EEGLAB and its plugins on the path, once per session.
%   [ok, msg] = ENSUREEEGLABREADY() runs eeglab('nogui') if EEGLAB is not
%   already reachable, and returns whether it is now usable. msg is '' when ok,
%   and a user-facing explanation when not.
%
%   Why this exists: adding the EEGLAB root to the path is NOT enough. EEGLAB
%   ships its functions in subfolders and its plugins in plugins/<name>, and
%   nothing resolves until eeglab() itself runs the path setup and the plugin
%   scan. On a cold MATLAB, with only the root added:
%
%       which('pop_loadset')          -> ''
%       which('pop_tesa_filtbutter')  -> ''
%
%   That matters because availableSteps decides what the picker offers by
%   probing which() for each step's requirements. Asking before EEGLAB has
%   initialised hides every plugin-backed step - 32 of 54 on a stock install -
%   and hides them the same way it hides a genuinely missing plugin, so the
%   user is told nothing is installed when everything is.
%
%   READINESS IS THE SENTINEL, NOT A FLAG. This used to return early whenever
%   `global PLUGINLIST` was non-empty, on the reasoning that PLUGINLIST is what
%   the plugin scan writes and therefore the state we depend on. That is right
%   about whether the scan RAN and wrong about whether its result is still
%   REACHABLE: nothing clears PLUGINLIST, so a restoredefaultpath, a test using
%   hideFromPath, or a pathdef reset left this reporting ready with pop_loadset
%   gone, and the next pop_loadset died with a bare "Undefined function".
%   pathMemo now owns that policy - probe the function we actually need - and
%   it still costs nothing when EEGLAB was initialised by someone else (a prior
%   run, the console, a test), because then the sentinel simply resolves.
%
%   The call is silenced with evalc: eeglab('nogui') prints a banner and a
%   line per plugin, which is noise in a GUI session and drowns the app's own
%   startup logging.
%
%   See also: pathMemo, availableSteps, stepAvailability, loadPrefs

% The memo stores the MESSAGE, and ok is derived from it. A cache hit requires
% the sentinel to resolve, so anything read back was computed on a run where
% EEGLAB came up - a stored failure is never returned, because a miss is
% retried. That makes ok exactly isempty(msg) at every point it is read.
