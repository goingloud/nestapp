function [params, accepted] = plotOptionsDialog(entry, params, anchor, context, onApply)
% PLOTOPTIONSDIALOG  Edit one plot's settings, generated from its registry entry.
%   [params, accepted] = PLOTOPTIONSDIALOG(entry, params, anchor, context, onApply)
%
%   entry    one element of plotRegistry(), whose .params drives the form
%   params   the values already set for this plot (struct, possibly empty)
%   anchor   optional figure to centre on
%   context  optional struct supplying choices for params that declare
%            'choicesFrom' - the windows in the table right now, say. Passed
%            straight to paramForm; nothing here reads it.
%   onApply  optional @(params) called on EVERY change, and again on cancel
%            with the original values, so the plot behind the dialog follows
%            what the controls say
%
%   Returns the edited params and whether the user accepted them. On cancel -
%   including the window's X - the input is handed back untouched.
%
%   EVERY PLOT SETTING IS A DRAW SETTING, which is what makes applying live
%   safe: none of them changes the estimates, so nothing here can re-run a
%   statistic as a side effect of a marker or a colour scale being adjusted.
%   Turning a band on and looking at a static picture is a poor way to choose,
%   and the reason the settings were unreachable in the first place was that
%   they were hard to evaluate.
%
%   If a COMPUTE setting is ever added - one that changes what groupCurves
%   returns rather than how it is drawn - it must not ride this path: mark it
%   in the registry and gate it behind an explicit Apply, or a colour change
%   starts silently recomputing the cohort.
%
%   Nothing here knows which plot it is editing. paramForm reads the makeParam
%   metadata and picks a control per setting, so a plot that declares a new
%   param in plotRegistry gets a usable editor for it with no change to this
%   file or to the tab. That is the whole reason plot params are makeParam
%   -shaped.
%
%   AN UNSET PARAM STAYS UNSET. Every control can say "default", and a setting
%   the user has not touched is absent from the returned struct rather than
%   frozen to a copy of whatever the default is today. So "I never touched this"
%   and "I set this to the default value" stay distinguishable - the first
%   follows the draw function if its default ever changes, the second does not.
%
%   Modal discipline: waitfor(fig) and a plain delete, never uiwait/uiresume.
%   A nested uiconfirm or uialert inside a figure already sitting in uiwait
%   leaves uiresume unable to release it, and the app hangs - the trap
%   selectDataTree documents and exploreFilesTable was caught by.

% Cancel, or the X, leaves the caller with exactly what it passed in. Edits are

% and the values in step - so the discard has to happen here.

% And because the changes were also being drawn as they were made, cancel has
% to put the PICTURE back too, not just the struct. A dialog that discards its
% values while leaving the plot showing them is worse than one that never
% previewed.
