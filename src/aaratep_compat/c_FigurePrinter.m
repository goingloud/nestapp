% C_FIGUREPRINTER  nestapp's replacement for AARATEP's figure-export helper.
%
%   AARATEP writes seven quality-control PNGs during a whole-pipeline run
%   (early channel rejection, eye-ICA components, decay fit and removal,
%   classified components, the final timtopo, and two debug plots). Every one
%   goes through c_FigurePrinter.copyToFile, so replacing this one class fixes
%   all of them at once.
%
%   THIS SHADOWS third_party/aaratep/Common/c_FigurePrinter.m. ensureAaratepOnPath
%   puts this directory on the path AFTER AARATEP's, so it wins. Fixing it here
%   rather than in the vendored copy is deliberate: third_party/aaratep is
%   git-cloned and git-ignored, so any edit there is lost the next time it is
%   re-fetched.
%
%   Three things were wrong with the original, and all three abort a cleaning
%   run that has otherwise succeeded:
%
%   1. A FAILED SCREENSHOT KILLED THE RUN. copyToFile let its exception escape,
%      so a QC image that could not be written took the whole pipeline with it -
%      after the actual cleaning step had already completed. Worse, it threw
%      between the plot and the close() that follows it, orphaning the figure on
%      screen. Here an export failure is a warning: the image is skipped, the
%      pipeline continues, and the caller's close() still runs.
%
%   2. THE REAL ERROR WAS DISCARDED. The original went through export_fig, whose
%      print2array does "catch ex; err = true; end" without ever assigning its
%      output. MATLAB then reports "Output argument A ... not assigned" and the
%      genuine cause is thrown away. exportgraphics is core MATLAB, needs no
%      Ghostscript, and reports its own failures honestly.
%
%   3. initialize() CLEARED GLOBALS MID-RUN. It called CopyFileToClipboard,
%      which calls javaaddpath, which "clears global and persistent variables".
%      Firing that partway through a batch, while EEGLAB globals are live, is
%      not something a screenshot should ever do. initialize() here does
%      nothing, which also stops AARATEP's export_fig from being prepended back
%      onto the path at run time.
