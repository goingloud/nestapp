%
%   report = INITPIPELINEREPORT(inputFile) returns a struct that accumulates

%
%   Fields
%     inputFile             - full path to the file being processed
%     processedAt           - datetime when processing started
%     steps                 - cell array of step records (one per completed step)
%     channels.original     - EEG.nbchan at Load Data
%     channels.nRejected    - cumulative channels removed (bad channel steps)
%     channels.nInterpolated- cumulative channels interpolated
%     channels.final        - EEG.nbchan after last step
%     trials.original       - epoch count at first Epoching step
%     trials.rejected       - cumulative rejected epochs
%     trials.final          - epoch count after last step
%     ica.nComponents       - components identified (set after Run ICA / Run TESA ICA)
%     ica.nRejected         - cumulative components removed
%     ica.nKept             - nComponents - nRejected
%     ica.varRemoved        - total % data variance removed (NaN if unavailable)
%     ica.varMin / varMax   - per-component variance range (NaN if unavailable)
%     ica.categories        - ICLabel breakdown (populated when ICLabel was run)
