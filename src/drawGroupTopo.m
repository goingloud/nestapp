function clim = drawGroupTopo(axList, res, opts)
% DRAWGROUPTOPO  One scalp map per group, by default on one shared scale.
%   clim = DRAWGROUPTOPO(axList, res, opts) draws the window-averaged scalp
%   distribution for each group into the corresponding axes of axList, and
%   returns the symmetric colour limits used - or [] when each map carries its
%   own scale, because then there is nothing one bar could describe. A caller
%   minting a shared colour bar must check for that.
%
%   axList must have at least one axes per group; the caller mints them, so
%   this works the same into a uifigure panel and into a publication figure.
%
%   opts:
%     .window   [t1 t2] in ms to average over (default the whole epoch)
%     .scale    'shared' (default) | 'per map'
%     .climit   scalar uV pinning the scale to [-climit climit]; overrides
%               .scale, since a stated number is a stated scale. 0 and
%               non-finite are read as no scale at all, i.e. derived
%     .clim     force colour limits outright (2-element); wins over both
%     .titles   cellstr overriding the per-map titles
%     .colorbar false when the caller draws its own shared bar (see
%               sharedColorbar); ignored under 'per map', where each map needs
%               its own
%     .markers  passed to drawScalpTopo: 'off' | 'dots' | 'labels'
%     .contours passed to drawScalpTopo: contour-line count
%
%   THE SHARED SCALE IS STILL THE DEFAULT, and for the usual reason: each map
%   drawn with its own limits makes two groups look alike whatever their
%   amplitudes - a 1 uV map and a 10 uV map both render as a full-range red and
%   blue dipole. Comparability by eye is the only reason to put maps side by
%   side, so nothing about the default view changes.
%
%   'per map' exists for the case the shared scale is bad at: one group an
%   order of magnitude larger flattens every other map to near-neutral, and
%   the TOPOGRAPHY of the smaller groups - which is a separate question from
%   their amplitude - becomes unreadable. Each map then gets its own bar, and
%   clim comes back empty so a caller cannot hang one shared bar over maps that
%   no longer share a scale.
%
%   'climit' answers a third question: holding the scale FIXED across runs, so
%   two exported figures can be compared. It is a scalar rather than a pair
%   because the limits must stay symmetric about zero - with a diverging map an
%   off-centre zero puts the neutral colour somewhere other than
%   no-deflection and misreads the polarity, which is drawScalpTopo's
%   invariant, not a preference.
