function [state, report] = exploreStateFromResults(source)
% EXPLORESTATEFROMRESULTS  Read a saved Results file back into Explore state.
%   [state, report] = EXPLORESTATEFROMRESULTS(source)
%
%   source may be:
%     - the struct exploreResults built, or
%     - the struct load() returns for a .mat containing one, under ANY variable
%       name. The Results exit saves it as `out` and assigns it as `tepResults`,
%       and a user is free to rename it, so the variable name is not part of the
%       format.
%
%   state:
%     .entries    1-by-N struct (path, subject, group, subjectConfident) -
%                 the files table, in exploreDataset's shape
%     .roi        cellstr of electrode labels
%     .windows    windows of interest
%     .design     'paired' | 'unpaired'
%     .mode       'TEP' | 'GMFP' | 'LMFP'
%     .plot       plot name to select, '' when the file does not name one
%     .plotParams name/params struct array of per-plot settings
%
%   report:
%     .ok       false when the source is not a results file at all
%     .missing  paths in the file that are not on disk now
%     .notes    cellstr of things the caller should tell the user
%
%   THE RESULTS FILE IS THE SESSION FORMAT. It already carries the files table,
%   the ROI, the windows, the design and the plot name, so a separate session
%   file would be a second artifact holding the same state - the "four confusing
%   exports" problem this rework exists to remove. What was missing was never a
%   way to write the state out; it was a way to read it back.
%
%   Paths are NOT resolved to the stored curves. A saved result holds group
%   averages, which is enough to redraw the figure and nothing else: change the
%   ROI or move one recording between groups and the averages are wrong. Resuming
%   WORK means recomputing from the files, so this returns the paths and reports
%   which of them have gone, and the caller reloads. Restoring a picture that
%   silently stops responding to the rail would be worse than refusing.
%
%   Nothing here is fatal except "this is not a results file". A file listing
%   recordings that have since moved is still worth opening for the groups, ROI
%   and windows it defines - that is the expensive human judgement the file
%   exists to preserve - so the missing paths are reported and the rest loads.
