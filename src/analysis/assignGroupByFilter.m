function [entries, nMatched] = assignGroupByFilter(entries, pattern, groupName, rootFolder)
% ASSIGNGROUPBYFILTER  Put every entry whose path matches a filter into a group.
%   [entries, nMatched] = ASSIGNGROUPBYFILTER(entries, pattern, groupName)
%   assigns groupName to each entry whose path contains pattern, and returns how
%   many were matched.
%
%   [...] = ASSIGNGROUPBYFILTER(entries, pattern, groupName, rootFolder) matches
%   against the path relative to rootFolder instead of the absolute path, so a
%   pattern cannot accidentally match something in the directories above the
%   data - typing "pre" should not match every file because the cohort happens
%   to live under C:\preprocessed.
%
%   Matching is a case-insensitive substring test on the path with separators
%   normalised to '/', deliberately identical to the filter in selectDataTree
%   (`contains(allRelLower, lower(query))`). That is the whole point: the filter
%   the user already types to FIND a condition's files is the same expression
%   that NAMES the group, so what you searched is what you grouped. Keeping the
%   two matchers in step is a correctness requirement, not a convenience.
%
%   An empty pattern matches nothing rather than everything - "I have not typed
%   a filter yet" must not silently sweep the entire cohort into one group.
%
%   Inputs:
%     entries    - struct array with at least a .path field; .group is written.
%     pattern    - char/string filter text.
%     groupName  - char/string group to assign to the matches.
%     rootFolder - optional char; paths are made relative to it before matching.
%
%   Outputs:
%     entries  - the input with .group set on matching elements.
%     nMatched - number of entries assigned.
%
