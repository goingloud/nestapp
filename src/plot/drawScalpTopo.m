%   ax       - destination axes. A classic axes is drawn into directly; a
%              uiaxes goes through a hidden figure (topoplot calls gca/clim/
%              axis, which a uiaxes does not support) and the result is copied
%              back.
%   values   - one scalar per channel (the time-window-averaged voltage, uV).
%   chanlocs - matching EEGLAB chanlocs struct array.
%   opts     - optional struct:
%                .clim      force these colour limits instead of deriving them
%                           from this map alone.
%                .colorbar  false to omit the colour bar. A grid of maps on one
%                           shared scale needs ONE bar, not one per map: twelve
%                           identical bars cost about 40% of the width and
%                           shrink every head to pay for it.
%                .markers   'off' (default) | 'dots' | 'labels'. Whether the
%                           electrode positions are drawn, and named.
%                .contours  number of iso-voltage contour lines, default 5.
%                           0 for a plain interpolated field.
%
%   Returns the symmetric colour limits actually applied, in uV.
%
%   opts.clim exists for comparing maps. Limits derived per map make any two
%   maps look alike whatever their amplitudes - a 1 uV map and a 10 uV map both
%   render as a full-range dipole - so a caller drawing one map per group
%   computes the limits once across all of them and passes them in. Without an
%   override the behaviour is unchanged: symmetric absmax from this map.
%
%   Markers are off by default because a scalp map's job here is the field, and
%   sixty-odd dots over a 40 mm head obscure it. They matter when the question
%   is WHICH electrode - a reader checking that a frontal focus really sits on
%   the channels the ROI names - so 'labels' exists for the figure that has to
%   answer that, and is unreadable at grid size on purpose: it is for one large
%   map, not twelve small ones.
%
%   The colour scale is plain linear microvolts: topoplot's default maplimits
%   is 'absmax', so the limits are symmetric about zero and recomputed for
%   every timepoint. We re-read them off the drawing axes and re-apply them to
%   the destination - copying only the children drops them, leaving the
%   destination silently autoscaled to the copied surface instead of the
%   limits topoplot chose. With a symmetric CLim and a diverging map, white is
%   exactly 0 uV and the colorbar reads directly.

% for the session was tried: topoplot resolves its target through gca, which

% received nothing and the maps came out blank. Making it handle-visible works
% but leaves a stray figure in the user's session for close all and any figure
% enumeration to trip over, which this function promises not to do. The repaint
% cost is addressed where it actually hurt - the resize handler coalesces a
% drag into one repaint rather than one per pixel.
