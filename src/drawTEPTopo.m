function info = drawTEPTopo(parent, res, opts)
% DRAWTEPTOPO  Curve panel with scalp maps above it, one column per window.
%   info = DRAWTEPTOPO(parent, res, opts) draws the composite figure: the group
%   waveforms across the bottom, and a grid of scalp maps above - one COLUMN
%   per window of interest, one ROW per group.
%
%   info returns .clim (the shared colour limits) and .axes (every axes made).
%
%   Rows are groups because that is what makes it a comparison. The classic
%   timtopo shows one dataset's maps in a strip; with n groups the same strip
%   per group, aligned on the same columns and the same colour scale, is what
%   lets a reader see that a component differs between conditions rather than
%   just that it exists. With one group it degenerates to the classic figure.
%
%   The maps AVERAGE OVER EACH WINDOW rather than sampling a single latency, so
%   a map and the number in the measures table describe the same interval by
%   construction. Change N45 to 40-55 ms and both move together. Sampling at a
%   window's midpoint instead would put a map beside a mean it does not match.
%
%   One colour scale across every map by default - per-map limits would make a
%   1 uV map and a 10 uV map look identical, which is the one thing a grid of
%   maps must not do.
%
%   'per window' scales each COLUMN instead, and is a different claim rather
%   than a weaker one: it keeps the groups comparable within a window, which is
%   the comparison the rows exist for, while letting a late component read at
%   all. P180 against a scale set by an early muscle-adjacent peak is a
%   uniformly neutral row that says nothing. Each column then states its own
%   limit in its title - with a symmetric diverging map that fixes the whole
%   mapping, white at 0 and the extremes at the stated value, so it needs no
%   bar of its own - and info.clim comes back EMPTY, the same signal
%   drawGroupTopo gives, so a caller cannot hang one shared bar over columns
%   that no longer share a scale.
%
%   The curve panel shades each window, so the reader can see which slice of the
%   waveform each column of maps came from - the linkage the dashed leader lines
%   in AARATEP's c_EEG_plotTimtopo draw. Shading is cheaper and does not break
%   when windows overlap.
%
%   opts:
%     .windows    window structs; omit for defaultTEPComponentDefs. Supplying an
%                 EMPTY set means no windows, and draws the curve alone
%     .mapWindows names of the windows to map, a subset of .windows; omit for
%                 all of them. Six columns is what crowds an 89 mm figure
%     .mapScale   'shared' (default) | 'per window'
%     .curve      false to omit the curve panel and give the grid the height
%     .mode       'TEP' | 'GMFP' | 'LMFP' for the curve's axis label
%     .xlim      curve time limits, default [-50 300]
%     .colors    group colours, default groupColors(nGroups)
%     .showBands shade the windows on the curve, default true
%     .axesFcn   @(parent, position) -> axes. Default makes uiaxes, which is
%                what an in-app panel needs; a publication figure passes a
%                classic-axes maker, because every export path drops UI
%                components. The alternative is sniffing the parent's type,
%                which is unreliable - a uifigure and a figure are both
%                matlab.ui.Figure.
