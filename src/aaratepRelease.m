%   Fields:
%     .tag          the pinned upstream release, e.g. 'v2.1.1'
%     .commit       the commit that tag resolves to
%     .repo         'owner/name' on GitHub
%     .zipUrl       archive URL for .tag
%     .sentinel     a function that must exist once installed

%
%   A PINNED RELEASE, NOT "LATEST", and this is the important decision in the
%   whole feature. AARATEP defines the behaviour of a published pipeline, so
%   two users running the same nestapp template must get the same AARATEP -
%   otherwise a result depends on the day the helpers were downloaded, which is
%   exactly the kind of silent divergence a preprocessing tool exists to
%   prevent. installAaratep therefore fetches .tag; it can REPORT that a newer
%   release exists, and will install one only when explicitly asked.
%
%   The pin is the same commit THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md records, and it happens
%   to be exactly upstream's v2.1.1 (the annotated tag dereferences to it), so
%   the tag is a stable, human-checkable name for what we already vendored
%   rather than a second source of truth.

%
% THREE LOCATIONS, because nestapp is used three ways and only the first two
% existed before it could be installed as a toolbox:
%
%   1. A path the user set explicitly - someone with their own clone, or a
%      shared lab copy on a network drive, should not have a second download
%      forced on them.
%   2. third_party/ next to the source. This is the developer checkout, the
%      layout THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES and CONTRIBUTING both describe, and it must
%      keep working exactly as before.
%   3. A folder under prefdir. This is the one that makes the wizard possible
%      for an installed toolbox: writing into an installed toolbox's own
%      folder would work today and then be deleted by the next upgrade or
%      uninstall, so a ~300-file download would silently vanish.

% 'aaratepPath' behind. A function that reports where things are has no
