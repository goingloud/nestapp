function [groups, overall] = datasetSummary(entries)
% DATASETSUMMARY  Files and SUBJECTS per group, plus complete-case counts.
%   [groups, overall] = DATASETSUMMARY(entries) describes a grouped dataset.
%
%   groups - 1xG struct array, one per group present, in first-seen order:
%     .name         group name
%     .nFiles       recordings assigned to it
%     .nSubjects    distinct subjects contributing - THE n for any estimate
%     .subjects     their ids, sorted
%
%   overall - struct describing the dataset as a whole:
%     .nFiles           total assigned recordings
%     .nGroups          number of groups
%     .nSubjects        distinct subjects anywhere
%     .completeSubjects subjects present in EVERY group
%     .nComplete        numel(completeSubjects)
%     .nUngrouped       entries with no group yet
%
%   Why nSubjects and nComplete are computed here rather than at each call site:
%   they are the two numbers most easily got wrong, and getting them wrong is
%   invisible. Averaging across FILES when a subject contributed four recordings
%   is pseudo-replication - it shrinks the confidence interval by up to a factor
%   of two on this cohort (8 participants, 32 recordings) while looking entirely
%   normal on screen. And a paired contrast is only defined on subjects present
%   in every group, so a figure claiming n=8 when one subject is missing their
%   post session is simply wrong. Both numbers belong on the figure.
%
%   Entries with an empty group are counted in overall.nUngrouped and excluded
%   from every group - they are not yet part of any comparison.
